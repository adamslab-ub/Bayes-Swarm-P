# Bayes-Swarm-P
A Penalized Batch-Bayesian Approach to Informative Path Planning for Decentralized Swarm Robotic Search

This repository contains code of our Bayes-Swarm-P algorithm that are used to solve multi-robot search and target localization problem. For further information on the Bayes-Swarm-P algorithm, please refer to our paper: Ghassemi, P., Balazon, M., and Chowdhury, S., A Penalized Batch-Bayesian Approach to Informative Path Planning for Decentralized Swarm Robotic Search, Autonomous Robots, 2022.
